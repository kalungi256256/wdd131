For this assignment, I interviewed Nansubuga Sarah, a bank teller working at Centenary Bank in Kampala. The purpose was to learn how writing is part of her daily responsibilities and how it influences her professional growth. From the conversation, I discovered that even in a role many might not immediately connect to writing, communication skills are central to efficiency and customer satisfaction.

When asked how much time she spends writing at work, Sarah explained that she writes for about two to three hours every day. Most of her writing involves filling transaction slips, preparing daily balance sheets, and sending email updates to her supervisor. She emphasized that even though the writing is usually short, it must be very accurate because financial records leave no room for errors. Regarding the types of writing she completes, she mentioned customer receipts, formal bank reports, and short notes for internal communication. These require different levels of detail and professionalism, depending on whether she is addressing a customer or her manager.

On the question of confidence, Sarah shared that she feels confident in routine writing like receipts and slips, but she sometimes struggles when drafting formal emails or reports in English, especially when using financial terms. She explained that with practice and occasional feedback from her supervisor, her confidence has improved. Finally, when asked how strong writing skills impact her work, she noted that good writing prevents mistakes that could cost the bank money, ensures customers trust the service, and helps her build a professional reputation among her colleagues.

From this interview, I learned that writing is essential in almost every career, even those we might think depend only on numbers. In Sarah’s case, accuracy and clarity in writing make her work smoother and her communication more reliable. I realized that writing in the workplace is less about long essays and more about being precise, professional, and efficient. For my own career, I will need to strengthen my ability to adjust writing depending on the audience—whether I am addressing a customer, a supervisor, or a colleague. This interview helped me see that good writing is not just a school requirement but a key to trust and growth in any profession.
